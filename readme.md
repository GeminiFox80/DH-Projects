# LIS 768 - Digital Humanities Analytics Homework 2

## Name: Gemini Fox

### I'm interested in German and Second Language Acquisition. In particular, I'm interested in how students learning German improve their writing skills, and want to do research how students use online translators while they write.

### Honestly, everything. I'm definitely green when it comes to programming of any kind, with most of my command terminal experience coming from recovering files and making small edits to server software. I'd love to take a crack at Python.
