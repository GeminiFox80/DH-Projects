# About Me

My name is Gemini Fox, and I'm very new to data science, as well as programming. The only experience I have is back from highschool ten years ago, and running a small Minecraft server for friends. However, I'm keen on learning more, especially how to work more closely with some corpus tools. I thought Voyant was an exceptionally cool program, which I think could be super useful in my line of work as a language instructor. I'm also interested in trying my hand at RegEx.

## Interests

I'm interested in German and Second Language Acquisition. In particular, I'm interested in how students learning German improve their writing skills, and want to do research how students use online translators while they write. I also like looking at complexity and accuracy of clausal structures produced by students when they write. Language improvement during study abroad is a big interest of mine too.

## Tools/methods

Honestly, everything. I'm definitely green when it comes to programming of any kind, with most of my command terminal experience coming from recovering files and making small edits to server software. I'd love to take a crack at Python, RegEx, and Voyant Tools. When we were looking at Voyant the other day in class, I was blown away by all of the things we could do with it, and immediately began thinking about making a student-written corpus which could be used by the Department of German here at UW. Of course, Voyant is a bit more on the basic side regarding lemmas and things, but it could still have practical applications.
